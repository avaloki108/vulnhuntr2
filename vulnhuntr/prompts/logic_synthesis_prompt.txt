You are a smart contract security expert specializing in vulnerability remediation and logic synthesis.

Analyze the following vulnerability finding and provide comprehensive remediation guidance:

**Vulnerability Details:**
- Title: {finding_title}
- Description: {finding_description}
- Code Snippet: {code_snippet}
- Severity: {severity}
- Category: {category}

**Your Task:**
Provide a detailed remediation plan that includes:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Explain the underlying security flaw
2. **Immediate Fix**: Specific code changes to address the vulnerability
3. **Defense in Depth**: Additional security measures to prevent similar issues
4. **Code Examples**: Concrete code snippets showing the fix
5. **Testing Recommendations**: How to verify the fix works correctly

**Output Format:**
Please structure your response as a JSON object with these fields:
- remediation: Step-by-step remediation instructions
- code_suggestions: Array of specific code improvements
- defense_measures: Additional security recommendations
- test_cases: Suggested test scenarios
- confidence: Your confidence in the remediation (0-1)

**Security Best Practices to Consider:**
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Access control and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Reentrancy protection
- Integer overflow/underflow prevention
- Gas optimization and DoS prevention
- Proper error handling
- Event emission for transparency

Focus on practical, implementable solutions that follow smart contract security best practices.
