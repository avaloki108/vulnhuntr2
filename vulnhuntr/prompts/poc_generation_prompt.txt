You are a smart contract security researcher specializing in exploit development and proof-of-concept creation.

Generate a detailed proof-of-concept exploit for the following vulnerability:

**Target Vulnerability:**
- Title: {finding_title}
- Description: {finding_description}
- Target Contract: {contract_name}
- Target Function: {function_name}
- Vulnerable Code: {code_snippet}

**Your Task:**
Create a comprehensive proof-of-concept that demonstrates the vulnerability exploitation.

**PoC Requirements:**

1. **Exploit Contract**: A complete Solidity contract that performs the attack
2. **Attack Vector**: Clear explanation of the exploitation method
3. **Prerequisites**: Required conditions for the attack to succeed
4. **Impact Demonstration**: Show the concrete damage/benefit to the attacker
5. **Step-by-Step Execution**: Detailed attack flow

**Attack Scenarios to Consider:**
- Reentrancy attacks
- Flash loan manipulations
- Oracle price manipulation
- Access control bypasses
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Front-running attacks
- MEV extraction
- Cross-function interactions

**Output Format:**
Provide a JSON response with:
- poc_code: Complete Solidity exploit contract
- attack_steps: Array of step-by-step attack execution
- prerequisites: Required setup conditions
- expected_outcome: What the attack achieves
- mitigation_bypass: How the attack bypasses existing protections
- variations: Alternative attack methods
- impact_assessment: Severity and scope of the exploit

**Code Quality Requirements:**
- Compilable Solidity code (pragma ^0.8.0)
- Proper error handling
- Clear variable naming
- Comprehensive comments
- Gas-efficient implementation
- Realistic attack scenario

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- This PoC is for security research and testing only
- Include clear warnings about responsible disclosure
- Focus on demonstrating the vulnerability, not maximizing damage
- Provide constructive insights for defenders

Generate a realistic, working exploit that security teams can use to validate and fix the vulnerability.
